Just posting my hw online

Somebody help!!!
I thought I was using Github correctly when I tried to upload all my homework files, but it seems like it didn't upload my original text file??? Wtf? It didn't even
upload the key.txt file...which was the important file. Without it, I'm unable to decipher onepunch.man.

The original plaintext file was a unique one-time download for each student, so now I can't even find it online...Please, someone help. If you can decipher the code, 
I will give you a huuuugge present, I mean ginormous (?). Please help me solve this before Christmas, it's my only shot of getting a passing grade for this class.
Just upload the key.txt file as a PR (or merge it directly to master, either works), and you would be a life-saver. Just...I have no idea how I'm going to be able
to crack the code and decipher that text without that key!!!

To help a bit...the one thing I do remember from creating the key the other day was that the password I put in were 2 words, no spaces...I just don't remember which 2. 
The end text contains the word "sound" in it I think. Oh! and do check out the hints folder I'll be creating...they might be useful.
