I am setting up hints in this folder with ANY information I find out. This will help, especially if you're struggling to come up with the answer. To make it more challenging on yourself, don't scroll down and read the helpful hints...but I would recommend going through them if you get stuck at the recommended time limit. See the file name FIRST before opening up its contents.
